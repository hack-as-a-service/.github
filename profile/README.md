# Hi! Welcome to Hack as a Service (HaaS)  👋

</div>   
   
### 🗃️ About: 

Hack as a Service (or HaaS) is Hack Club's own PaaS (Platform as a Service): A scalable, simple, and inexpensive way for Hack Clubbers to host backend services (including web apps, games, Slack bots, and more). 

#### :octocat: Here's a list of our main repositories, containing the code that powers the project:

- [Frontend](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service/frontend) 
- [Backend & API](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service/api)
- [CLI](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service/cli)
- [Documentation](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service/docs)

Hack as a Service is powered by a few core services that handle different responsibilities. The CLI, the GitHub bot and our other backend services are currently undergoing a rewrite in Rust. Our documentation site uses mdBook with a custom theme to match the design of the frontend. The frontend uses Next.js, along with Chakra UI and a slightly modified version of @hackclub/theme.

### 🛠️ Contribution:
Contributions to the project are welcome! So if you want to help with it, check out our [documentation](https://haas.hackclub.com/docs/) and then go to the repository you want to contribute in order to see more details about it.
